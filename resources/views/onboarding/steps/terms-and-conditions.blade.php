                    that the NICU journey can be very emotional. As a diverse group, it is inevitable that you may
                    disagree with some posts or replies. Choose kindness and consideration when interacting with
                    other families navigating life in and after the NICU. If you find it difficult to say something kind or
                    considerate, simply move on from a post and recognize that it is okay to not engage in every
                    post. It is okay to disagree with something or share an alternative point of view, but always do
                    so with respect and kindness.
